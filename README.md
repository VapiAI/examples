A collection of example assistants, squads, and tooling built with [Vapi](https://vapi.ai) — the platform for building voice AI agents. These examples are curated by Vapi forward-deployed engineers and follow best practices for production deployments.

## New to Vapi?

Get started with the [Quickstart Guide](https://docs.vapi.ai/quickstart/introduction) to build your first voice assistant in minutes.

Then explore:

- **[Dashboard](https://dashboard.vapi.ai/)** — Sign up and manage your assistants
- **[API Reference](https://docs.vapi.ai/api-reference)** — Full API documentation
- **[SDKs](https://docs.vapi.ai/resources)** — Client libraries for Web, Python, and more
- **[CLI](https://docs.vapi.ai/cli)** — Command-line tools for development

Once you understand the basics, import these examples into your organization and customize them for your use case.

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
# Clone with all submodules (recommended)
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/VapiAI/examples.git

# Or if you've already cloned without submodules:
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

> **Note:** Some examples (like GitOps) are linked as submodules. The commands above ensure you get all content.

### 2. Sign Up

Create a free account at [dashboard.vapi.ai](https://dashboard.vapi.ai/).

### 3. Choose an Example

Browse the examples below and pick one that matches your use case.

### 4. Import & Customize

Each example includes ready-to-use configurations. Import the assistant JSON into your Vapi dashboard, customize the prompts and tools, and you're ready to go.
